# Naive Bayes on Credit Card Dataset
In this experiment I trained my model on 10,000 records and looked at the 5 features which are Geography, isActiveMember, HasCrCard,Balance,CreditScore and then the class of Exited which is binary 1 or 0, the goal is to use the 5 features to predict the class. Then the accuracy of the model was tested on 2,000 records (83/17 train test split)
